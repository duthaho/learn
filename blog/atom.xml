        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My first goals in starting my blog were to advance my professional development and position myself as an expert in the IT fields I was interested in. I like writing and felt I had something important to share.</p>
<p>After six years of blogging, I find it difficult to identify myself as the engineer I was before writing became a daily practice. It's ironic that, in the end, my blog—though perhaps not for the reasons I had anticipated—opened the door to my next professional chapter. I thought I might use it as a sort of portfolio and a way to prepare for an interview if I could write some engaging blogs, but it developed into so much more than that.</p>
<p>After a period of writing technical articles, I was shocked to find that writing was a tool to help me give my ideas more rigor rather than merely a way for me to explain things to an audience. Writing a blog article about a technical subject ended up being a lot of work since I cared about my reputation and my potential readers. I was aware that if I didn't take care while writing, not only would I be wasting people's time, but I would also become the target of internet trolling. I thus limited my writing to topics that I understood at a basic level or how I planned to get the deep expertise I needed initially.</p>
<p>Writing reveals all these things that you thought you understood but actually don't, which is one of its wonderful benefits. This is particularly valid when you are aware that it will be read by capable and informed individuals. As soon as you begin going into great detail to describe something—including how it works, the trade-offs, the alternatives, and so forth—your internal BS detector will quickly go off. It is shouting, "What evidence do you have for this statement?," and "How do you know that!" You come to the realization that your words are useless and your knowledge is built on unstable grounds. To be able to authentically describe all of this, you set out to find the missing parts, the insights, and the underlying truths.</p>
<p>After a time, I realized that my blog had taught me how to think. It showed me how to find ideas that few others had noticed. It got me to the next level I needed to be at. Later on, as a result of my excellent postings, I gradually gained awareness in my particular field of technology, which converted into additional job offers.</p>
<p>My advice is to not think of blog writing as something that people undertake to improve their "personal brand." It can certainly help with that, but it is first and foremost a tool that individuals can use to improve their knowledge and critical thinking.</p>
<p>It's like thinking training; it makes you more strong, which leads to increased comprehension and insight. Blogging is less popular than it once was, but don't let that discourage you; in the end, the person who benefits the most, even if only a few people read it, is you.</p>]]></content>
