I was aware that if I didn't take care while writing, not only would I be wasting people's time, but I would also become the target of internet trolling.

It is shouting, "What evidence do you have for this statement?," and "How do you know that!" You come to the realization that your words are useless and your knowledge is built on unstable grounds.
